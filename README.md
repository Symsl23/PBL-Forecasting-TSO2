# üìà Forecasting Algorithm Selection ‚Äì IoT Sensor Data Project

This document explains the rationale behind selecting **Linear Regression** and **Holt-Winters** as the forecasting algorithms for our IoT Sensor Data Forecasting System, which uses an ESP32 microcontroller and Google Sheets + Apps Script for processing and visualization.

## üîç Project Context

The system collects time-series data from a DHT11 sensor (temperature and humidity) and aims to forecast future values to support early detection, pattern monitoring, and decision-making. The goal is to choose forecasting methods that:
- Handle real-time sensor data effectively
- Can be implemented in **Google Apps Script**
- Provide both **trend** and **seasonal pattern** insights

## ‚úÖ Selected Forecasting Algorithms

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Simple Moving Average (SMA) to smooth out temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor. The DHT11 is a basic, low-cost sensor used to measure temperature and humidity, but its readings may fluctuate due to minor environmental changes or sensor noise. SMA helps to filter out these short-term fluctuations and display a more stable reading.

## ‚ùì Why SMA is Selected
- Simplicity: Easy to implement using arrays and basic math.

- Effectiveness: Reduces short-term fluctuation (noise) in DHT11 readings.

- Low Resource Use: Ideal for use in microcontrollers and cloud scripts like Google Apps Script.

## üëç Benefits

- Simple Forecasting Technique : Its predict the forecast value based on the recent data trends.
- Noise Reduction : SMA help to smooth sensor data noise and give more stable value.
- Easy to Implement : SMA used a basic math(everage calculation) to predict next value.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Poor for Long-Term Forecasting : Its work well for short-term and not suitable for long-term or irregular patterns.
- Cannot Handle Missing or Irregular Data : Gaps or inconsistent reading can affect the average value.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Apps Script Implementation
Google Apps Script is used to log DHT11 sensor data (from ESP32 or similar) into Google Sheets and apply SMA for smoothing.

### Example Code Snippet (Apps Script):
```javascript
function calculateSMA(values, period) {
  if (values.length < period) return null;

  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = values.length - period; i < values.length; i++) {
    sum += values[i];
  }
  return sum / period;
}

function logSensorData(temp, hum) {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("SensorData");
  sheet.appendRow([new Date(), temp, hum]);

  const data = sheet.getRange("B2:B").getValues().flat().filter(Number);
  const sma = calculateSMA(data, 5); // Using last 5 readings

  if (sma !== null) {
    const row = sheet.getLastRow();
    sheet.getRange(row, 4).setValue(sma); // Column D for SMA
  }
}
```

## üì¶ Future Plans
To improve forecasting:
- Add error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) to ensuring forecasting are reliable and justifiable
- Introduce ARIMA or another advanced algorithm for better accuracy and adaptibility
- Enable anomaly detection using forecast deviation to trigger alert if exceeds a threshold
